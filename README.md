# CS355-Summer-2018

I took CS 355: Internet and Web Technologies at Queens College working with HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and learned some Bootstrap. Here is a link to the website I had running.

Website: https://venus.cs.qc.cuny.edu/~avma9035/ (I know, it looks lkinda weird, but it ws my first time making one)

Most of the files comes from my website. Some files such as .pdf, .docx, etc are not avaliable.
